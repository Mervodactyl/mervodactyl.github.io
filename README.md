## My very own blog site charting the Mervodactyl's flight path into the matrix
### Posts include techy stuff and points of interest

Site built on Jekyll and hosted on Github, uses Type theme as a basis for front end design - hacked to suit my own needs




# Type Theme

A free and open-source [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme. Great for blogs and easy to customize.
