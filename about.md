##Silk's Road - the be all and end all

###The Site itself

This particular blog is hosted by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) & [Github](https://github.com/), and is designed to chart the '[Mervodactyl](https://github.com/Mervodactyl)'s flight path into the Matix', otherwise known as 'Silk's Road'

This means there are posts about anything and everything that interests me as a web developer, and what learning has been like and continues to be like from the front lines. For the most part, its felt like repeatedly jumping off a cliff into a sprawling mess of cryptography, hence the site blub. But thats not to say it hasn't been and continues to be, glorious and challenging and amazing too.

My own insights and perspectives on digital matters are discussed in the hope that others may find them useful. While web development is the main theme, every post is not necessarily tech related, some posts are just about my own personal topics of interest and what I'm up to

__TLDR:__
 Blog site written by [Mervé Silk](https://github.com/Mervodactyl) covering web development related subjects and general topics of interest

###About Me

>[Mervé Silk](https://github.com/Mervodactyl):  Sea Slug enthusiast, Dog lover, MTG player (B/G/B), book worm, only Digimon fan on the planet, wannabe Hulk.

I only noticed coding when a [friend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharnasommerville) of mine, having heard me complain about my job for the nth time, told me to give coding a go (something that I could put my stubborn nature to good use with apparently...). Considering I didn't even own a computer until about 6 years ago this seemed utterly rediculous to me. Coding was done by people who were born into techy families and grown up in an information rich environment, had lots of cash for computer spending, were unnaturally clever, and did nothing else with their lives.

Luckily, I was incredibly niave and wrong.

Thanks to free online places like [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) giving me a chance to give code a test run, a whole world that had previously felt alien not to mention terrifyingly complex opened up to me. It had been years since I had applied myself so diligently to problem solving, and felt a huge sense of accomplishment when I wrote my very first 'Hello World!' post on what was a tiny pitiful html page. But it was my page, and it blew my mind. I'm happy to say coding still does. How many people can say that about their day job?

__TLDR:__ [Mervé Silk](https://github.com/Mervodactyl), aka Sea Slug enthusiast, Dog lover, MTG player (B/G/B), wannabe Hulk. Started coding 9 months ago, first computer was bought 6 years ago, no thats not a typo. Coding was intimidating, but now I can't live without it
